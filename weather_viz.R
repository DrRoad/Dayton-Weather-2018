# Create Required Data Sets -----------------------------------------------

# create dataframe that represents 1995-2013 historical data

# create dataframe that represents current winter data

# Required Formatting -----------------------------------------------------

# create y-axis variable
a <- dgr_fmt(seq(-20, 100, by = 10))

# create a small dataframe to represent legend symbol for 2017 Temperature
legend_data <- data.frame(x = seq(175, 182), y = rnorm(8, 15, 2))

# create dates for last day of each month
last_days <- present %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  slice(last(day)) %>%
  .$new_day

# Create graphic ----------------------------------------------------------
